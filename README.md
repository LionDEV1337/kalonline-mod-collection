# kalonline-mod-collection

This Repo contains very old code i written for the Game [Kal Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kal_Online). This is basicly a collection of some (cool) game modifcations like extra commands, server and clientside cheat protection, level extension, monster spawns, ... . Since Kal Online is a closed source game the only way to modify the game is via low level hooks, hence i used C++ and inline assembly. There is a more or less inactive development forum section on [Ragezone](http://forum.ragezone.com/f241/) were we shared our thoughts, code and ideas. Since i left the dev community some years ago and my code is also published there, i simply thought why not adding it here. The code is very ugly written (cryptic inline assembly, no code conventions, crap ...), you have been warned.

Tools i used:

 - [IDA Pro](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/)
 - [OllyDbg](http://ollydbg.de/)
 - Visual Studio 2010
